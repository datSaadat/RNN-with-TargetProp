**Note** : The original code is in Theano

 


<br>
The code is also simulated to run on a memristor using A Programming Error, added at each step of the weight updates. This is done on the TPTT_nazmus_v1
Furthermore, Quantization is done to incorporate the functio of the ADCs. This is done on the TPTT_nazmus_v2 </br>
